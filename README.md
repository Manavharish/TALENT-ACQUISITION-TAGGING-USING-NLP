# TALENT-ACQUISITION-TAGGING-USING-NLP

The number of applications for each position is rising quickly. It is challenging for employers to comb through the many resumes to find the greatest fit. Each position has its own requirements it might be challenging. Our goal is to Create an NLP(Natural Language Programming) to identify and match the best candidate for a job. The main task is to identify the resumes that match the keywords in the Job Descriptions. Finally, the model should produce an output where it displays the top best candidates for each role. we developed a Bert model to identify the candidates and make it easy for Recruiters.

Install:

This project requires Python to run all the code files.
This project requires NLTK, pandas, and other libraries to execute the code and solve the problem. Install python and load the required libraries to work on the project.

Code:

We have folders for resumes we used, job descriptions used to match with resumes and get scores and also the selected candidates for each role. There are 4 ipynb files in that Resumemain which is the major file to work on the resumes like cleaning and biagrams. Next resume select which has the code to select the resumes for each job role among all the candidates who applied. The next one is visualizations which have the findings from the project like word clouds, histograms, and bar plots. The last one is on the metric comparison of the percentage of each model we used to work on the project.

Run:

Use this read me file to understand and use the code files to achieve the project.
